#The main objective of this graduation project is to develop a force diagram reconstruction method based on diffusion models. Existing force diagrams primarily consist of 2D cross-sections and are mainly used as auxiliary tools in structural analysis. Traditional force diagram generation methods, such as Autoencoders (AE), Variational Autoencoders (VAE), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), suffer from limitations in accuracy and directional representation due to their inherent latent structures. In contrast, diffusion model-based force diagram generation methods offer a more effective representation and theoretically achieve higher reconstruction quality. However, research on the application of diffusion models in force diagram generation remains in its early stages, with many unresolved challenges.
